BV Node Pack is a collection of deep workflow tools for **regional prompting**,
**structured prompts**, **Smart Pipes**, **Subgraph interfaces**, reusable graph
controls and deterministic latent utilities.

The pack targets current ComfyUI workflows and treats stable data contracts,
Subgraph behavior and graceful failure as first-class features.

> [!NOTE]
> **AI-assisted development:** BV Node Pack was created with extensive assistance
> from generative AI during architecture exploration, implementation, debugging,
> testing and documentation. Product direction, requirements, technical decisions,
> code review and validation in real ComfyUI workflows remain human-led. This
> project does not claim to be solely hand-written; AI-assisted contributions are
> reviewed and tested before publication.

> BV Node Pack includes frontend extensions. Restart ComfyUI and hard-refresh the
> browser after installing or updating so Python nodes and JavaScript stay in sync.

## Regional prompting

![BV Regional Editor with overlapping rectangle and brush regions](docs/assets/regional/regional-editor-title.png)

The model-neutral `BV_REGIONAL` document separates authoring from execution. The
editor stores prompts, geometry and stable identities; compiler nodes translate
that document for a particular model/backend.

[![Anima regional prompting result](examples/images/anima-android-dance-regional-showcase.png)](examples/images/anima-android-dance-regional-showcase.png)

This Anima example uses two independently conditioned androids, small overlapping
interaction rectangles around their hands and a painted light-arc region. The
character prompts do not encode left/right placement; the regional document supplies
the spatial guidance.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Regional conditioning is spatial guidance, not a hard segmentation or layout
> constraint. A model can extend subjects beyond a region, move an interaction,
> blend attributes or ignore part of the requested composition. `joint` overlap
> lets overlapping pixels attend to multiple regional contexts; it does not force
> the depicted subjects to interact. Region strength changes conditioning influence,
> not boundary strictness.
>
> Reliable results come from the combination of clear prompt engineering, region
> geometry and overlap suited to the actual spatial task, and the model's learned
> priors. Attention routing guides the composition; it does not make an implausible
> layout deterministic.

### Core workflow

1. Add **BV Regional Prompt** and open it from the node or BV toolbar action.
2. Define Global and Background prompts.
3. Add regions, then draw rectangles or additive/subtractive brush layers.
4. Connect `regional` to a compiler:
   - **BV Regional Native Conditioning** for standard masked ComfyUI conditioning;
   - **BV Regional SDXL Attention** for model-internal cross-attention routing on
     compatible SDXL checkpoints;
   - **BV Regional Z-Image Attention** for joint-attention routing on Z-Image Turbo;
   - **BV Regional FLUX.2 Klein 9B Attention** for exact-architecture joint-attention
     routing on FLUX.2 Klein 9B;
   - **BV Regional Krea 2 Attention (Experimental)** for main single-stream
     joint-attention routing on Krea 2;
   - **BV Regional Anima Conditioning** for the built-in Anima attention backend;
   - **BV Regional Color Control Image** for a model-neutral solid RGB control image;
   - **BV Regional Anima LLLite** to load and apply a local Anima LLLite model patch through ComfyUI core.
5. Connect `patched_model`/`positive`/`negative` to a standard KSampler.
6. Optionally return the latest image through **Preview Send** or **Save Send**.

Optional regional LoRA hooks are available on the native-conditioning, Anima
attention and experimental Krea 2 attention paths. Connect an external `LORA_STACK`
producer to **BV Named LoRA Stack**,
chain its registry into the conditioning node, and connect the prompt node's
`lora_bindings` sidecar output. The editor can then assign one unchanged live stack
globally and one additional stack per region. The registry and bindings inputs are
optional; workflows that do not connect them retain the previous regional LoRA
behavior. Empty stacks and entries whose model and CLIP strengths are both zero are
valid no-ops.

Anima attention evaluates one full model pass for the global baseline plus one masked
pass for every distinct effective regional model stack. Regions with identical model
stacks share a pass, and CLIP-only strength differences do not add model passes. A
single regional stack therefore normally doubles sampling work, while two different
regional stacks normally triple it. Actual runtime and peak VRAM depend on the model,
resolution, sampler and ComfyUI memory management.

`BV Regional Anima Conditioning` also exposes the experimental
`regional_lora_mode` selector. Its default remains `multipass_legacy`, preserving
published Anima workflows and their image results. `token_gated_singlepass` applies
compatible model-side LoRA deltas directly to the assigned regional text and
spatiotemporal image tokens while regional attention routing is active. After
`end_percent`, regional text routing stops as configured, while the spatially masked
image-side LoRA deltas decay with the remaining sampling sigma from full strength
towards 35% at the end. This preserves late character identity while leaving the base
model more room for fine geometry and without extending the more aggressive regional
text context through the entire denoising schedule. CLIP-side LoRA strengths continue to be
applied while each regional prompt is encoded. Unsupported or non-maskable model
layers fail explicitly; select `multipass_legacy` for those LoRAs. When `base_ratio`
is greater than zero, Anima still evaluates its intentional unmodified baseline pass,
so "single-pass" refers specifically to eliminating the additional per-stack
regional LoRA passes.

| Anima regional LoRA mode | Recommended use | Trade-off |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `multipass_legacy` (default) | Published workflows, maximum compatibility and quality-sensitive interaction scenes | One additional model pass per distinct effective regional model stack |
| `token_gated_singlepass` (experimental) | Faster iteration and compositions whose subjects remain mostly spatially separated | Different image result; overlapping subjects and anatomy can receive competing regional LoRA influence |

Single-pass routing controls where compatible LoRA deltas are applied; it cannot
guarantee anatomy or resolve contradictory prompts beyond the underlying model's own
capabilities. Direct subject interaction, shared limbs, hands, embraces and broad mask
overlaps remain difficult cases even without regional modification. Use
`multipass_legacy` when those details matter more than sampling speed. Existing Anima
workflows that do not store `regional_lora_mode` continue to resolve to
`multipass_legacy`.

### Named LoRA stack interoperability

The incoming community `LORA_STACK` value itself is an unlabelled runtime list:

```json
[["path/to/lora.safetensors", 0.8, 0.6]]
```

`BV Named LoRA Stack` wraps one or more of these stacks in the public,
JSON-compatible `BV_LORA_STACK_REGISTRY` v1 contract. Other node packs may emit
that type directly, including stable `id`, display `name`, and unchanged stack
entries, without depending on BV's sender node. See the complete contract and
example in [BV Regional LoRA Bindings v1](docs/specs/bv-regional-lora-bindings-v1.md)
and its [JSON Schema](schemas/bv_lora_stack_registry_v1.schema.json).

The editor supports additive and subtractive rectangles, ellipses, polygons and brushes,
live tool outlines with pixel dimensions, a resolved binary-mask inspection mode,
overlap, priority ordering, undo/redo, multi-selection, lossless compound-layer merging,
resolution-aware disconnected-area splitting, layer controls, zoom, pan, WYSIWYG aspect
ratios, document import/export and persistent per-document UI state.

### Regional detailer loop

The detailer loop turns the editor's enabled `detailer` and `both` regions into
ordered jobs. Each iteration receives the image produced by the previous iteration,
the region-aware `BASIC_PIPE`, the composed mask and the region's prompt context.
Connect `BV Detailer Loop Detect to SEGS (Impact)` to an Impact **Detailer (SEGS)** node when
detector refinement is required; without a registered detector, the mask is
converted directly to `SEGS`.

The tested public wiring is:

```text
BV Regional Prompt ---------> BV Regional Detailer Plan
BV Detector Registry -------> BV Regional Detailer Plan
BV Regional Detailer Plan --> BV Detailer Loop Start
initial image --------------> BV Detailer Loop Start

BV Detailer Loop Start.loop_state --> BV Detailer Loop Job Resolver
model + clip + vae ----------------> BV Detailer Loop Job Resolver
BV Detailer Loop Job Resolver.detailer_job/current_image/region_mask
    --> BV Detailer Loop Detect to SEGS (Impact)

BV Detailer Loop Job Resolver.current_image/basic_pipe
    + BV Detailer Loop Detect to SEGS (Impact).SEGS
    --> Impact Detailer (SEGS/pipe)

BV Detailer Loop Start.flow + Impact Detailer.image
    --> BV Detailer Loop End.final_image
```

Only the six BV nodes shown in this wiring are part of the user-authored loop.
The recursive control nodes marked `(internal)` are implementation details and are
created by ComfyUI during graph expansion; they should not be placed manually.

`BV Detector Registry` connects to `BV Regional Detailer Plan`, which validates
assignments and owns the registry for all jobs. The Registry provides a visual list
of detector IDs and model names and supports several detectors in one node. It loads
Ultralytics, ONNX and optional SAM models internally through the installed Impact
providers, so ordinary workflows do not contain provider, binding or chained
registry nodes. The plan dialog selects these detector IDs from a dropdown. Impact
Pack is therefore required for detector loading and the documented `SEGS` detailer
path, but the BV plan and regional-mask contracts remain package-neutral.
`BV Detector Binding` remains an optional advanced input for third-party detector
objects. It removes unusable placeholder outputs, so an Ultralytics BBOX model's
non-functional segmentation sentinel is not treated as a connected segmentation
detector. Detection runs only on the padded regional crop; returned coordinates are
rebased to the full image before detailing.

The default plan creates one job per eligible region. Its **Configure Detailer Plan**
dialog groups regions, changes job order, combines masks, selects prompt composition
and assigns detector IDs without exposing the serialized JSON contract. A job without
a detector uses its composed regional mask directly. A detector-backed job restricts
detection to the padded regional crop, intersects the result with the regional mask
and sends full-image coordinates to Impact. Every completed iteration becomes the
input image of the next job, so later jobs retain earlier detailer changes. See
[BV Detailer Plan v1](docs/specs/bv-detailer-plan-v1.md) for the contract and wiring.

### Spatially aware regional prompt enhancement

The prompt-enhancement workflow keeps proposal and mutation separate:

This is not a generic prompt rewriter. The enhancer is **spatially aware**: it
receives the canvas, region geometry, hierarchy, overlap, priority and the existing
Global, Background and regional prompt relationships as immutable context. It uses
that context to improve scene coherence, spatial wording and object ownership while
changing prompt text only; region identities, masks and workflow structure remain
protected. Spatial awareness is guidance rather than a deterministic layout promise:
LLM output and image sampling can still fluctuate, and the target image model may
duplicate or mis-bind an object despite a correct enhanced prompt.

`BV Regional Prompt Enhancer` separates prompt language from enhancement freedom.
Choose `Anima / hybrid` for sentence-aware hybrid prompts, `Natural language` for
prose-oriented models, or `Tag only / SDXL` for conservative tag collision cleanup.
The `creativity` control ranges from `0.0` (spelling, grammar and sentence correction)
to `1.0` (coherent creative scene enhancement). Immutable regional structure and
source facts remain protected at every level; tag-only mode is internally capped at
`0.3`.

```text
BV Comfy CLIP LLM Provider ─┐
                            ├─> BV Regional Prompt Enhancer ─> BV Apply Regional Enhancement
BV Remote LLM Provider ─────┘
```

`BV Remote LLM Provider` defaults to the generic `OpenAI Compatible` profile.
Choose `OpenAI`, `Venice`, `Abacus.AI`, `Ollama`, `LM Studio`, `llama.cpp`,
`vLLM`, `LocalAI`, or a custom OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions endpoint,
then enter any compatible model ID. `OpenAI`, `Venice` and `Abacus.AI` use fixed
catalog endpoints; Abacus.AI uses the self-service RouteLLM endpoint and defaults to
`route-llm`. The node UI updates the endpoint when the provider changes and makes it
read-only for fixed profiles. `custom_endpoint` is editable only for the generic profile. HTTPS is required
except for loopback servers such as LM Studio or Ollama. The provider requests
strict JSON-schema output and does not enable tools or web search. The Venice
profile additionally disables Venice's own system prompt. Local profiles use managed
loopback endpoints without API keys. `Local OpenAI Compatible (Custom)` accepts a
custom loopback endpoint without authentication; the external custom profile retains
Bearer-key authentication.

#### Tested model recommendations

These are practical starting points from the regional Anima sentence-prompt tests,
not a universal model ranking:

| Use case | Model / node setting | Effort | Notes |
|---|---|---:|---|
| Recommended local default | [`Qwen/Qwen3-8B-GGUF`](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-8B-GGUF) as `hf.co/Qwen/Qwen3-8B-GGUF:Q4_K_M` through Ollama | `low` | Best local balance tested for strict JSON, natural wording and source preservation |
| Low-resource local fallback | `qwen3:4b` through Ollama | `low` | Functional and schema-compatible, but more likely to produce awkward tag/prose mixtures and weaker enhancements |
| Existing ComfyUI-local alternative | [`qwen3vl_8b_fp8_scaled.safetensors`](https://huggingface.co/Comfy-Org/Qwen3-VL/blob/main/text_encoders/qwen3vl_8b_fp8_scaled.safetensors) through `BV Comfy CLIP LLM Provider` | provider-managed | Good tested enhancement quality, but uses the ComfyUI model path and more of the generation machine's resources |
| Recommended paid baseline | `gpt-5-mini` through an available OpenAI-compatible provider | `low` | Strong tested quality without requiring a frontier-priced model |
| Quality/reference test | `gpt-5.5` through an available OpenAI-compatible provider | provider-supported | Strong result, but substantially more expensive and unnecessary as the default |

Start with `creativity = 0.5`. Use the same enhancer input, settings and image seed
when comparing models. Evaluate the returned prompt diff separately from the rendered
image: an image model may still duplicate or mis-bind objects even when the enhanced
prompt correctly requests a single object. Model IDs can vary between providers; use
the exact ID exposed by the selected service. Vision capability is not required for
the remote/Ollama path because the enhancer sends text and JSON only.

Install or start the recommended Ollama model directly with:

```powershell
ollama run hf.co/Qwen/Qwen3-8B-GGUF:Q4_K_M
```

<details>
<summary><strong>Anima example: original vs. spatially enhanced prompt</strong></summary>

This controlled comparison uses the same Anima workflow and image seed
`827414017477856` for both outputs. The enhanced path used
`hf.co/Qwen/Qwen3-8B-GGUF:Q4_K_M` through Ollama with
`reasoning_effort = medium`, `creativity = 0.5`, Anima/hybrid prompt language,
eight Euler Ancestral steps and CFG 1. In this sample, spatial enhancement keeps one
cup near the woman and restores the open notebook near the man. Results remain
probabilistic; other LLM responses or image seeds may be less consistent.

| Original regional prompt | Spatially enhanced regional prompt |
|---|---|
| ![Original Anima regional prompt result](docs/assets/regional/prompt-enhancer/anima-original.png) | ![Spatially enhanced Anima regional prompt result](docs/assets/regional/prompt-enhancer/anima-spatially-enhanced.png) |

</details>

Successful remote responses are cached persistently under
`user/default/bv_nodepack/cache/remote_llm/v1`. The cache identity covers the
effective request payload, provider, endpoint and model but never the API key.
An identical request therefore does not create another paid external call after
unrelated workflow edits or a ComfyUI restart. Changing prompts, model, provider,
endpoint, reasoning settings, token limit or a non-zero seed creates a new request.

Provider definitions are loaded from
`data/ai/providers/remote_llm_providers_v1.json`. This versioned package catalog
contains endpoints and suggested defaults but no user configuration or secrets.
New profiles that use an existing adapter can therefore be shipped without changing
the node implementation.

On first use, BV creates the user-owned settings file
`user/default/bv_nodepack/remote_llm_settings.json`. It is never replaced by a
NodePack update. Set `default_profile_id` and optional per-profile overrides there;
new provider nodes use those values as their initial workflow snapshot. For example:

```json
{
  "schema": "bv.remote_llm.settings",
  "version": 1,
  "default_profile_id": "abacus",
  "profile_defaults": {
    "abacus": {
      "model": "route-llm",
      "reasoning_effort": "none",
      "timeout_seconds": 60
    }
  }
}
```

Use the node's `Configure <Provider> API Key` button to save, replace or delete a
key. Keys are stored separately in the user-owned
`user/default/bv_nodepack/remote_llm_secrets.json`; the settings endpoint reports
only whether a key is configured and never returns its value. API keys are not
serialized into workflows. Review `custom_endpoint` before queuing imported
workflows because the generic profile sends its configured secret to that host.

The enhancer may issue one repair request after a rejected initial response. The
Apply node independently revalidates the result and returns the canonical source
unchanged when the proposal is invalid, stale or belongs to another document.

### Impact Pack detailer integration

**BV Regional Detailer Mask** is a package-neutral bridge to
[ComfyUI-Impact-Pack](https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Impact-Pack). It does not
import Impact modules or reproduce the internal `SEGS` structure. Connect a
`BV_REGIONAL` document, the single image that will be detailed, `MODEL`, `CLIP`,
`VAE` and a named region. The node renders the region at the image dimensions,
encodes unmasked `Global + Region` positive/negative conditioning and returns
`BASIC_PIPE = (model, clip, vae, positive, negative)`. Connect `image`, `mask` and
`basic_pipe` directly to `MaskDetailer (pipe)`; Impact's separate `ToBasicPipe` node
is not required. Positive/negative conditioning and resolved prompt text remain
available as additional outputs for advanced compositions. Background prompts are
intentionally excluded from the cropped detail pass. Impact detailers do not accept
image batches, so this bridge rejects batches larger than one explicitly.

The Regional Editor stores this routing directly in the `BV_REGIONAL` v2 document
through each region's **Usage** setting: `Generation`, `Detailer only`, or
`Generation + Detailer`. Detailer-only regions remain visible and editable but are
excluded from every generation compiler. Disabled regions are excluded from both.
Legacy v1 documents and v1 region imports are migrated automatically with
`usage: "generation"`, preserving their previous render behavior; new documents and
exports use v2.

The detailer bridge encodes every scope separately. `global_influence` defaults to
`1.0`, `background_influence` to `0.35`, and `primary_region_influence` to `1.0`.
Dynamic context-region rows add any other enabled region with an independent
influence value; choosing a region in the final `None` row creates the next row.
The primary region alone defines the mask, while context regions contribute prompts
only. Duplicate and primary-region context assignments are rejected by the UI.
Every influence accepts `0.0` (disabled) through `2.0`.
Alongside the plain resolved prompt outputs, `positive_weighted_text` and
`negative_weighted_text` expose the same active scopes in standard ComfyUI syntax,
for example `(blue eyes:0.35)`. These strings are intended for inspection and reuse;
the Basic Pipe continues to use the separately encoded conditioning entries and
their native strength metadata.

Supported compositions use Impact's public nodes:

- Direct masked detailing: connect `image`, `mask` and `basic_pipe` to `MaskDetailer (pipe)`.
- Editable segment workflows: connect `mask` to `MASK to SEGS`, then use
  `Detailer (SEGS)` or `SEGSDetailer` plus `SEGSPaste`.
- Detector gating: connect detector `SEGS` and the BV `mask` to
  `Pixelwise(SEGS & MASK)`, then feed the filtered `SEGS` to `Detailer (SEGS)`.

The detector-gating path is preferred for faces: the detector retains precise face
geometry while the BV region limits which person's detections may be processed.
`FaceDetailer` has no external `MASK` or `SEGS` input and therefore cannot be fed
directly by this bridge. For multiple regions or different detailer prompts, create
one bridge per region and combine the resulting Impact `SEGS` with Impact's own
label/concat nodes.

### Native conditioning composition

**BV Regional Native Conditioning** keeps `blend` as the backward-compatible
default and offers three experimental comparison modes:

- `blend` emits unmasked Global plus masked Background/Region conditionings;
  ComfyUI normalizes their overlapping denoiser predictions.
- `exclusive` combines Global text with each scoped prompt and emits only masked,
  mutually scoped passes. This avoids Global/Region averaging inside opaque regions.
- `hybrid` interpolates both execution layouts. `hybrid_blend_ratio=0` is exactly
  `exclusive`, `1` is exactly `blend`; intermediate values trade additional
  denoiser/hook groups for shared composition and regional identity.
- `mask_bounds` retains `blend` semantics but asks ComfyUI to crop masked model
  evaluations to each mask's bounding area.

All modes accept arbitrary rendered masks and regional LoRA hooks. `exclusive`
and `mask_bounds` are intended for controlled model-specific evaluation; neither
is guaranteed to outperform `blend` for every architecture or composition.

### Regional LoRA validation examples

These are controlled examples, not a guarantee that arbitrary LoRAs will combine
cleanly. Training quality, dataset composition, trigger design, model compatibility,
LoRA strength, seed and composition mode can all change the result substantially.
The downloadable example workflows use the external
[ComfyUI-Lora-Manager](https://github.com/willmiao/ComfyUI-Lora-Manager) as their
`LORA_STACK` producer. It is required to load those graphs without missing nodes,
but it is not a runtime dependency of BV Node Pack: any compatible `LORA_STACK`
producer can feed `BV Named LoRA Stack`.

#### Two character LoRAs from one series and creator

[![Two independently hooked Anima character LoRAs](examples/images/anima-dual-regional-character-loras-hybrid-035.png)](examples/images/anima-dual-regional-character-loras-hybrid-035.png)

This test assigns [Nyamena](https://civitai.com/models/2749213/nyamena-around-40-otoko-no-isekai-tsuuhan-anima?modelVersionId=3092643)
to the left region and [Myaley](https://civitai.com/models/2749226/myaley-around-40-otoko-no-isekai-tsuuhan-anima?modelVersionId=3092658)
to the right region. Both character LoRAs come from the same series and creator,
recommend the same `0.8-1.0` range and were tested at `0.8`. That makes this a
useful compatibility case, but also a deliberately favorable pairing; it must not
be generalized to unrelated or poorly trained LoRAs.

### SDXL attention routing

**BV Regional SDXL Attention** patches a cloned SDXL model and routes independently
encoded text slots through cross-attention. Global text remains available everywhere,
Background text is limited to uncovered pixels, and each regional text slot is exposed
inside its rendered mask. `joint` overlaps expose every participating region. The node
returns a patched model plus positive and negative conditioning for a standard KSampler.

The backend is architecture-based rather than checkpoint-specific. It is interactively
verified with
[WAI Illustrious SDXL v1.70](https://civitai.com/models/827184/wai-illustrious-sdxl?modelVersionId=2883731)
and
[Pony Diffusion V6 XL](https://civitai.com/models/257749/pony-diffusion-v6-xl?modelVersionId=290640).
Other SDXL-family checkpoints are expected to use the same seam, but remain unverified
until tested. Non-SDXL models are rejected instead of being patched speculatively.

Recommended starting values are Attention Strength `1.0`, Start `0.0`, End `0.5`.
The active interval controls how long spatial routing is applied; it is not equivalent
to region strength. Attention routing remains generative guidance, not hard segmentation.
Attention Strength `0` does not bypass the backend: it hides regional and Background
slots while leaving Global context active. Bypass the node for a true unpatched A/B run.

<details>
<summary><strong>WAI Illustrious SDXL — Attention versus untuned Native baseline</strong></summary>

The comparison used the same regional document, seed `486012994155188`, checkpoint,
sampler, scheduler, steps, CFG and resolution. Native Conditioning was intentionally
used without model-specific strength or mask tuning. The evidence therefore shows
better out-of-the-box separation, not that Native Conditioning cannot be improved.

### Z-Image Turbo attention routing

**BV Regional Z-Image Attention** targets the Lumina2/S3-DiT-style joint-attention
architecture used by Z-Image Turbo. It patches a cloned model, keeps Global text
available throughout the image and spatially routes Background and regional text
slots through the unified text/image attention matrix. `joint` overlaps expose all
participating regional contexts.

The verified model family is available from the official
[Z-Image Turbo model page](https://huggingface.co/Tongyi-MAI/Z-Image-Turbo).

The node returns a patched model, positive conditioning and zero negative
conditioning for a standard KSampler. Z-Image Turbo does not use a conventional
negative CFG branch, but ComfyUI's KSampler still requires a negative input. The
backend is architecture-gated and rejects FLUX, SDXL, Anima and unrelated models.

Recommended starting values are Attention Strength `1.0`, Start `0.0`, End `0.5`.
The backend was interactively verified at 1024 x 1024 with `res_multistep`, eight
steps, CFG `1.0`, the `simple` scheduler and `ModelSamplingAuraFlow` shift `3.0`.
These are test values rather than universal quality recommendations.

<details>
<summary><strong>Z-Image Turbo — Attention versus untuned Native baseline</strong></summary>

The comparison used the same regional document, seed `336492265582909`, model,
sampler, scheduler, steps, CFG and resolution. Native Conditioning was intentionally
left at its default strength. Both approaches preserved broad left/right placement;
joint-attention routing retained the requested white/cyan and black/orange attributes
more precisely, while the Native result shifted the right suit toward beige and gold.

### FLUX.2 Klein 9B attention routing

**BV Regional FLUX.2 Klein 9B Attention** patches a cloned model and routes Global,
Background and regional Qwen3-8B text contexts through all double- and single-stream
joint-attention blocks. The result works with normal ComfyUI model-patcher sampling
paths, including KSampler and SamplerCustom workflows; no BV-specific sampler is
required.

The node deliberately accepts only the exact FLUX.2 Klein 9B architecture. It rejects
Klein 4B, full FLUX.2 and unrelated models instead of applying a speculative patch.
The distilled 9B profile has no conventional negative-prompt branch, so the node emits
zero negative conditioning for ComfyUI nodes that require a negative input. Model
weights are not bundled and remain subject to the
[FLUX Non-Commercial License](https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.2-klein-9B/blob/main/LICENSE.md).

Attention Strength controls regional routing influence; Start and End define its active
sampling interval. These controls are independent from each region's own strength.
Regional attention remains generative guidance rather than hard segmentation.

The backend does not replace or repair the model's sampling configuration. Keep the
sampler, scheduler, step count, guidance, LoRAs and model-sampling settings that already
work for the chosen FLUX.2 Klein setup. For a meaningful A/B comparison, hold those
settings, the prompt and the seed constant and change only the regional backend.

<details>
<summary><strong>FLUX.2 Klein 9B — verified regional separation</strong></summary>

The first local run used unsuitable external sampling settings and produced the same
poor quality with and without the BV node. After correcting the caller-owned sampling
configuration, the unpatched baseline and the regional run both rendered cleanly. The
regional result retained that quality while keeping the white/cyan and black/orange
character attributes spatially separated.

### Experimental Krea 2 attention routing

**BV Regional Krea 2 Attention (Experimental)** patches a cloned Krea 2 model and
routes Global, Background and regional Qwen3-VL text contexts through all 28 main
single-stream joint-attention blocks. It works with a normal KSampler.

> [!WARNING]
> **Temporary Krea 2 FP8 limitation:** The `multipass_legacy` regional LoRA hooks
> can currently fail on
> quantized Krea 2 models with
> `AttributeError: 'Linear' object has no attribute 'weight_scale'` (or a similar
> missing quantization attribute). This is an upstream ComfyUI core issue tracked
> in [ComfyUI #14382](https://github.com/Comfy-Org/ComfyUI/issues/14382), not a
> missing BV Node Pack dependency. To keep regional LoRAs connected, use a
> non-quantized Krea 2 model or apply the upstream temporary `model_patcher.py`
> workaround described in that issue. Remove any local core patch after ComfyUI
> ships an official fix.

Four upstream text-fusion/refiner blocks execute before the public attention-patch
seam and remain global. The backend therefore improves spatial prompt-to-region
binding but is not strict end-to-end isolation.

Krea 2 Raw retains conventional CFG and negative-prompt semantics. Krea 2 Turbo is
normally used near CFG 1, where a separate negative branch has little or no practical
effect. Attention Strength, Start and End control routing; per-region strength remains
independent.

The node also accepts the optional `lora_registry` and `lora_bindings` outputs from
the named-stack workflow. Assigned stacks are applied to the matching Global,
Background or region scope while the existing Krea attention router remains active.
`regional_lora_mode` controls only model-side LoRA execution; it does not change the
stored regional document, prompt routing, masks or `joint` overlap semantics:

- `token_gated_singlepass` is the default. Compatible Krea LoRA
  and LoKr deltas are evaluated in activation space and multiplied by their regional
  text/image-token masks inside one model pass. Results are intentionally not expected
  to match legacy seeds pixel-for-pixel.
- `multipass_legacy` preserves the previous execution method. Every distinct effective
  model-side LoRA stack requires another full denoiser pass.

Workflows saved before `regional_lora_mode` existed do not contain an explicit legacy
marker. Loading them after this change therefore selects the new single-pass default
and can change their image result. Select `multipass_legacy` explicitly when exact
reproduction of an older Krea regional-LoRA workflow matters.

The single-pass path keeps regional CLIP-hook encoding, supports reference-image
tokens without exposing regional LoRAs to them, and fails rather than applying a
non-spatial model layer globally. Switch that workflow back to `multipass_legacy` if
a LoRA contains no compatible Krea token layers or requires an unmaskable model layer.
The mode and patch counts are logged when the model is prepared.

The verified tests showed stable character and outfit separation, region reassignment,
and a wide empty center when prompts and masks supported that composition. This is
evidence of useful routing, not a guarantee: prompt engineering, region geometry and
overlap, the actual need for regional separation, model priors, seed, and sampling
settings still work together.

interact around the center. In the observed result, hair color, appearance and skin

case, not a guarantee for unrelated, incompatible or overtrained LoRAs.

<summary><strong>Krea 2 — incompatible regional style LoRAs in one continuous scene</strong></summary>

This boundary test deliberately combines two strongly different style LoRAs:

on the left and [CRT Vaporwave](https://civitai.com/models/2856432/crt-vaporwave?modelVersionId=3226199)
on the right. Two 55-percent-wide masks create a 10-percent `joint` overlap. Both
LoRAs use model and CLIP strength `1.0`; mask feather is `0.04`, attention strength
is `1.0`, and routing is active from `0.0` to `0.5`.

| Regional style LoRAs active | Regional LoRA inputs disconnected |
| --- | --- |
| ![Krea 2 with Detailcore and CRT Vaporwave assigned regionally](docs/assets/regional/krea2-dual-style-lora-active.png) | ![Krea 2 control without regional LoRA inputs](docs/assets/regional/krea2-dual-style-lora-disabled.png) |

The two outputs use the same seed, prompts, regions and sampler settings. In the
control, the LoRA source nodes still contain their entries, but `lora_registry` and
`lora_bindings` are disconnected from the Krea node; no regional LoRA model passes
are therefore executed. The subject matter remains because it is requested by the
regional prompts, while the two trained image languages are substantially reduced.

The enabled result keeps Detailcore's dense mechanical construction concentrated on
the left and CRT Vaporwave's cyan-magenta retro-futuristic atmosphere concentrated on
the right. The road, perspective and lighting remain one continuous composition
through the overlap rather than becoming two independent panels.

### Experimental Anima LLLite layout control

**BV Regional Anima LLLite** adds learned layout guidance to the prompt-to-region
binding supplied by **BV Regional Anima Conditioning**. It is an Anima `MODEL_PATCH`,
not a classic ComfyUI `CONTROL_NET`: BV renders the regional document to a solid
RGB image, ComfyUI loads the LLLite weights, and the patch modifies the Anima model
during the selected sampling interval.

```text
Anima MODEL -> BV Regional Anima Conditioning -> BV Regional Anima LLLite -> KSampler
                         |                                  |
                         +-> positive / negative            +-> control image / legend
```

Download the adapter separately from
[Sen-sou/Anima-LLLite-Regional-Controlnet](https://huggingface.co/Sen-sou/Anima-LLLite-Regional-Controlnet),
place it under `ComfyUI/models/model_patches/`, then restart ComfyUI. BV does not
bundle or download model weights. The verified reference starts with Strength
`1.0`, Start `0.0`, End `1.0`; shorter intervals and lower strengths intentionally
allow more model freedom.

Both images were executed with seed `766291715444885`, the same model, LoRA,
prompts, regional document and sampler settings. Only the LLLite model patch differs.

| LLLite active — Strength 1.0, 0.0–1.0 | LLLite bypassed |

The active patch keeps both subjects on a more comparable scale and depth plane.
The bypassed render retains regional character binding but allows a much freer layout.

</details>

LLLite remains guidance rather than hard segmentation. It does not associate prompt
text with a color by itself, guarantee object boundaries or force an interaction.
Read the complete **[Anima LLLite regional-control guide](docs/anima-lllite-regional-control.md)**
for architecture, settings, verified behavior, limitations and licensing boundaries.

## Prompt autocomplete

BV Prompt Autocomplete uses local datasets and does not require another completion
extension. The bundled `data/completion/bv_default_tags.csv` is active by default.

- Supports legacy four-column CSV and extensible header-based CSV/TSV files.
- Preserves descriptions, provenance, safety scores and unknown future metadata.
- Inserts tag names with spaces while retaining canonical underscore tags as metadata.
- Works in the Regional Editor, Quick Edit and ordinary ComfyUI multiline widgets.
- Opens at the active caret by default; placement can be changed globally to below
  the complete text field under **Settings → BV Node Pack → Prompting**.
- Can be disabled globally or inside the editor when another completer should own fields.
- Supports multiple ordered datasets; the topmost enabled source wins duplicate tags.

Custom widgets can opt out with `data-bv-autocomplete="off"` on the textarea or an ancestor.
An absolute dataset may be forced with the `BV_COMPLETION_DATASET` environment variable.

## Smart Pipes

**BV Smart Pipe** carries a chain-growing set of values identified by stable slot
IDs. Each node exposes only the inputs and outputs required at that point in the workflow.

### Incremental slot inheritance

Unlike fixed pipe systems, a Smart Pipe does not expose one global port list on
every node. Each node inherits the complete slot contract of its selected predecessor
and may append new slots locally. Those additions become available only from that
point downstream; they do not appear retroactively on earlier nodes or unrelated branches.

| Chain position | Visible contract |
| --- | --- |
| Loader pipe | Local `model`, `clip`, `vae` |
| Prompt pipe | Inherited `model`, `clip`, `vae` + local `positive`, `negative` |
| Sampling pipe | Everything inherited above + local `latent`, `seed` |

Inherited slots can be passed through unchanged or overridden at the current node.
Because every slot has a stable logical identity, downstream connections continue to
refer to the correct value even when labels change or an upstream slot is temporarily missing.

[![Smart Pipe wireless merge](examples/images/smart-pipe-wireless-merge.png)](examples/images/smart-pipe-wireless-merge.png)

- Wired and wireless routing can be mixed.
- Each branch inherits only its own upstream slots and can grow independently.
- Bypassed nodes pass inherited state without applying local writes.
- Muted nodes stop only their dependent execution branch.
- Removed upstream slots remain identifiable instead of silently shifting connections.
- **BV Smart Pipe Merge** combines branches in explicit user-defined order.
- Missing sources and cycles fail closed.

Configure each Smart Pipe and Merge through its BV floating editor. The editor uses
the shared window navigator, keeps draft history in memory, supports undo/redo and
explicit Save/Discard, and absorbs compatible external node or link changes without
losing the current draft. Draft JSON can be copied or imported for fast recovery.

Smart Pipe predecessors remain directly selectable on the node for fast graph authoring;
the native widget and floating editor stay synchronized. Local slots are required inputs,
can be reordered by drag and drop without changing their stable IDs, and remain compatible
with existing serialized workflows. Smart Pipe and Merge windows are hidden from the
global window overview by default and can be made discoverable with the title-bar eye
control. The visibility flag is stored in the workflow, not in browser preferences.

The legacy **BV Pipe Config** and **BV Pipe** nodes remain available only for existing
workflows.

> Wireless routing across Subgraph boundaries relies on prompt materialization because
> ComfyUI does not currently expose an official pre-prompt extension hook. Keep physical
> pipe links in compatibility-critical workflows.

## Structured Prompt AST

Prompt AST nodes preserve semantic categories instead of repeatedly parsing flattened text.

[![Prompt AST categories](examples/images/prompt-ast-categories.png)](examples/images/prompt-ast-categories.png)

| Node | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| BV Prompt Encode | Parses tagged source into `BV_AST` plus cleaned text |
| BV Prompt Category Switch | Enables/disables categories with inheritance and any/all matching |
| BV Prompt Decode | Materializes selected categories as plain text |
| BV Prompt AST Debug | Displays the current AST as formatted JSON |

See the **[Prompt AST syntax and markup guide](docs/prompt-ast-guide.md)**.

## Subgraph interface nodes

These nodes build readable, purpose-specific Subgraph surfaces instead of exposing
an undifferentiated list of widgets.

[![Subgraph UI layout](examples/images/subgraph-ui-layout.png)](examples/images/subgraph-ui-layout.png)

| Node | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| BV Subgraph Heading | A projected section title with optional divider |
| BV Subgraph Divider | A projected visual separator |
| BV Subgraph Spacer | Controlled vertical spacing |
| BV Dynamic Combo | A controlled choice that also emits string, integer and float views |

Presentation identity and serialized port identity remain separate so reload,
copying and nested Subgraphs do not reorder exposed controls.

To project one of these presentation nodes onto a Subgraph interface:

1. Create or open the Subgraph and add the presentation node between the controls
   it should visually separate.
2. Expose the node's left input as a Subgraph input.
3. Wire the surrounding data inputs to preserve the intended interface order.
4. Return to the parent graph. The exposed input is rendered as the heading,
   divider or spacer instead of an ordinary editable field.

<details>
<summary><strong>Heading: internal wiring and resulting Subgraph</strong></summary>

The heading input is exposed between the controls that should appear above and below it.

![Heading wired inside a Subgraph](docs/screenshots/bv_subgraph_heading_in_subgraph.png)

The parent Subgraph node renders that exposed position as a heading:

![Heading rendered on a Subgraph](docs/screenshots/bv_subgraph_heading_subgraph.png)

The heading text, font size and optional divider remain configurable on the inner node:

## Workflow control

**BV Control Center** defines named workflow states and applies explicit
`Activate`, `Mute` or `Bypass` actions to graph/Subgraph groups.

[![Control Center workflow states](examples/images/control-center-workflow-states.png)](examples/images/control-center-workflow-states.png)

- Multiple Control Center nodes remain synchronized.
- Groups are discovered recursively in the root graph and inside Subgraphs,
  including nested Subgraphs, and are shown with their qualified Subgraph path.
- `Mute` and `Bypass` are applied to the nodes contained in the selected group,
  even when that group lives inside a Subgraph definition.
- A group belongs to its reusable Subgraph definition. If that definition has
  several instances, its controlled node modes therefore apply to every instance.
- Active conflicts resolve deterministically as `Activate > Mute > Bypass`.
- Conflicts and unresolved groups remain visible and block unsafe execution.
- Base node modes are restored when controls stop applying.
- The shared Control Center window is a workflow-global singleton even when several
  Control Center nodes exist; all instances edit the same workflow configuration.
- Configuration changes autosave and participate in the shared bounded undo/redo history.
- The **Controls** tab applies states immediately, while **Configuration** manages groups;
  Configuration opens initially when no controls have been defined.
- The dedicated toolbar action appears only while a Control Center node exists.

## Architecture and compatibility

- Stable IDs are authoritative; names and labels are presentation.
- UI state is stored separately from semantic workflow documents.
- Optional model integrations load lazily and cannot prevent unrelated nodes from registering.
- Standard KSampler compatibility depends on the selected compiler/backend.
- Missing capabilities fail visibly instead of silently degrading prompt meaning.
- Nodes 2.0 and Subgraph behavior are tested independently from root-node rendering.

## Current scope

- Regional overlap execution currently supports `joint`; other modes are reserved.
- Native regional conditioning provides masks, not model-internal attention isolation.
- Built-in attention backends currently target Anima, SDXL-family models,
  Z-Image Turbo, FLUX.2 Klein 9B and experimental Krea 2.
- Regional negative isolation depends on backend capability.
- Regional results always combine prompt engineering, region geometry and overlap,
  model priors and sampling; attention routing guides rather than forces exact composition.
- Region placement, overlap and strength guide conditioning but cannot guarantee
  exact object boundaries, poses, depth order or pixel-perfect interactions.
- Wireless Smart Pipe compatibility remains sensitive to upstream prompt lifecycle changes.

## Changelog

  required Microsoft Fluent Emoji MIT attribution.
- Replace the legacy Regional Editor window and minimized-window spiral with
  the canonical Cyclone geometry.
- Keep the layout-profile icon compact and readable when a session layout is
  modified instead of allowing the footer control to expand.

### 2026-08-23 — v0.18.1

- Restore pointer interaction for every Regional Editor drawing tool after the
  shared BV toolbar migration.
- Close polygon drawings by clicking the initial point once at least three
  vertices have been placed.
- Fix autocomplete styling and caret-relative placement in long, scrolled or
  transformed text areas, and refresh suggestions when the cursor moves.

### 2026-08-22 — v0.18.0

- Move Smart Pipe and Smart Pipe Merge configuration into the shared BV window
  framework with synchronized native widgets, stable drag ordering and guarded drafts.
- Add bounded in-memory undo/redo, Save/Discard baselines, draft JSON recovery and
  three-way migration for compatible external graph changes.
- Add workflow-owned window-menu visibility with Smart Pipes hidden by default,
  recoverable hidden-node discovery and graph/subgraph-scoped node identities.
- Integrate the workflow-global Control Center into the shared tabbed BV UI with
  autosave, immediate control actions and conditional toolbar discovery.
- Add editor-type layout profiles, session working layouts, timed BV toasts and
  ComfyUI-modal-safe window layering as reusable framework services.
- Harden Smart Pipe Merge routing across bypassed or muted sources and preserve
  active predecessor values during prompt materialization.
- Document the BV window lifecycle and persistence contract and extend regression
  coverage for routing, history, discovery, lifecycle and responsive behavior.

### 2026-08-22 — v0.17.0

- Add the shared BV UI module and offline component showcase as the canonical
  implementation and visual reference for BV-owned controls, dialogs and windows.
- Unify Regional Editor, Quick Edit, Detailer Plan and Detector Registry window
  chrome, multi-node navigation, persistent switch preference and minimized shelf.
- Add node-owned window state, full edge/corner resizing, responsive header and
  footer overflow, compact contextual help and a restrained shared radius scale.
- Refine the Regional Editor dock, layer ordering, compact inspectors, Detailer
  Plan jobs and Detector Registry summaries using reusable production controls.
- Add frontend regression coverage for shared UI integration, window lifecycle,
  responsive behavior, preferences, geometry and regional interaction ordering.

### 2026-08-21 — v0.16.0

- Add the visual `BV Regional Detailer Plan` for ordered per-region jobs with
  grouping, mask/prompt composition, per-job conditioning and optional named
  detector assignment.
- Add `BV Detector Registry`, which configures several self-loaded Ultralytics,
  ONNX and optional SAM detectors in one node while retaining an advanced binding
  adapter for compatible third-party detector objects.
- Add the public Detailer Loop Start, Job Resolver, Impact Detect-to-SEGS and End
  workflow, carrying the plan, current image and job index through one loop state
  instead of exposing recursive implementation wiring.
- Run detector inference only inside each padded regional crop, rebase detections
  to full-image coordinates and gate the resulting `SEGS` with the composed region
  mask; jobs without a detector use their region mask directly.
- Preserve each processed image as the input to the next job, allowing detector-
  backed and mask-only Detailer/Both regions to run sequentially with their own
  positive and negative prompt context.
- Validate the complete seven-job Anima workflow in ComfyUI with Person, Hand and
  Face detector assignments plus detectorless regional jobs and an Impact
  `Detailer (SEGS/pipe)` consumer.
- Add frontend and Python regression coverage for plan/registry configuration,
  optional detector routing, ROI coordinate rebasing, loop-state propagation and
  recursive graph expansion.

### 2026-08-20 — v0.15.0

- Add spatially aware regional prompt enhancement that uses immutable canvas,
  geometry, hierarchy, overlap and prompt relationships to improve scene coherence,
  spatial wording and object ownership without changing region structure.
- Add separate proposal and verified-apply nodes with Anima hybrid, natural-language
  and conservative tag-only policies plus a bounded creativity control.
- Add compatible local generation through ComfyUI CLIP and configurable
  OpenAI-compatible HTTP providers, including managed profiles for hosted services,
  Ollama, LM Studio, llama.cpp, vLLM and LocalAI.
- Store provider keys separately from workflows and keep user settings independent
  from the versioned provider catalog.
- Cache successful provider responses by effective enhancer input so unchanged
  requests do not trigger another paid call after workflow edits or restarts.
- Document tested local and hosted model recommendations, direct model links and the
  remaining nondeterminism of LLM output and image-model object binding.

### 2026-08-20 — v0.14.0

- Add `BV Regional Detailer Mask`, a package-neutral bridge that renders a selected
  BV region and emits an Impact-compatible `BASIC_PIPE` with separately encoded
  positive and negative conditioning.
- Add `BV_REGIONAL` v2 region usage modes for generation, detailer-only or both;
  migrate v1 documents deterministically to generation usage.
- Let the primary region define the detail mask while optional context regions add
  independently weighted prompt conditioning without expanding that mask.
- Expose Global, Background, primary-region and context-region influence controls,
  plus plain and ComfyUI-weighted resolved prompt text for inspection.
- Preserve dynamic primary/context selections across workflow save and reload by
  serializing only the canonical backend widget values in stable order.
- Document direct `MaskDetailer (pipe)`, editable `SEGS` and detector-gated Impact
  workflows without importing or vendoring Impact Pack internals.

### 2026-08-20 — v0.13.0

- Add experimental `token_gated_singlepass` regional model-LoRA execution to
  `BV Regional Anima Conditioning` while retaining `multipass_legacy` as the default
  for backward compatibility and published-result reproduction.
- Apply compatible regional LoRA deltas to Anima text and spatiotemporal image tokens
  inside the existing attention pass, eliminating additional per-stack model passes.
- Preserve global LoRAs, scoped CLIP encoding and the intentional unmodified
  `base_ratio` pass; reject unsupported or non-maskable model layers explicitly.
- After the configured attention window, stop regional text routing and retain a
  spatial image-LoRA tail that decays towards 35 percent to reduce late identity drift.
- Document that single-pass output intentionally differs from multipass and that
  overlapping subjects, shared anatomy and contradictory prompts remain limited by
  both competing regional influence and the underlying model's generative capability.

### 2026-08-20 — v0.12.0

- Add token-gated single-pass regional LoRA and LoKr execution to
  `BV Regional Krea 2 Attention (Experimental)`: compatible adapter deltas are
  multiplied by their regional text/image-token masks inside one model pass.
- Make `token_gated_singlepass` the new Krea regional-LoRA default while retaining
  `multipass_legacy` as an explicit reproduction and compatibility fallback.
- Preserve regional CLIP-hook encoding, inherited global stack semantics, intentional
  duplicate adapters, promptless regional LoRA masks and Krea reference-image tokens.
- Fail explicitly when a LoRA requires a model layer without a spatial token axis
  instead of silently applying that layer globally; log adapter and patched-layer counts.
- Validate the single-pass path with the existing dual-style Krea workflow on Krea 2
  Turbo FP8 at 768 x 768, eight steps and CFG 1; the observed run completed in about
  20.6 seconds and produced a coherent overlap without a hard regional seam.
- Document that workflows saved before `regional_lora_mode` existed select the new
  default when loaded and may therefore render differently; select `multipass_legacy`
  when exact reproduction of an older Krea regional-LoRA result matters.

### 2026-08-19 — v0.11.0

- Add optional regional LoRA hooks to `BV Regional Krea 2 Attention (Experimental)`
  without changing workflows that leave the new inputs disconnected.
- Encode every Krea text slot with its assigned scoped CLIP hooks, then compose
  distinct model-side LoRA stacks as mask-weighted full-model passes.
- Preserve the existing 28-block Krea attention router and remove slot-local hook
  metadata before the combined conditioning reaches the sampler.
- Validate two independently assigned character LoRAs with 20-percent overlapping
  regions, including a shared interaction area, and document the substantial
  multipass memory and runtime cost.

### 2026-08-19 — v0.10.1

- Add optional regional LoRA hooks to `BV Regional Anima Conditioning` while
  preserving workflows that leave `lora_registry` and `lora_bindings` disconnected.
- Compose regional LoRA model effects as masked full-model passes without changing
  the existing Anima attention router; share passes between identical model stacks.
- Keep empty and fully disabled LoRA stacks as valid no-ops, and avoid additional
  model passes when regional stacks differ only in CLIP strength.
- Document the expected baseline-plus-distinct-stacks pass count and its sampling
  performance impact, with regression coverage for global, regional and overlapping use.

### 2026-08-19 — v0.10.0

- Add optional regional LoRA hooks to `BV Regional Native Conditioning` while
  preserving previous workflows that use only the original `BV_REGIONAL` output.
- Add chainable `BV Named LoRA Stack` registry nodes and a documented public v1
  registry/bindings contract for compatible external `LORA_STACK` producers.
- Add `exclusive`, `hybrid` and `mask_bounds` native composition modes alongside
  the backward-compatible `blend` default; reject unsupported Anima mask-bounds
  execution with an explicit compatibility message.
- Treat assigned but currently empty or disabled LoRA stacks as valid no-ops.
- Reconcile region bindings when documents are loaded, imported, edited or queued;
  preserve document and binding state together across editor undo and redo.
- Search autocomplete candidates inside tags while retaining prefix matches first,
  and expose LoRA stack selection in the Quick Prompt Editor.
- Document controlled Anima dual-character and skin-tone isolation workflows with
  fixed settings, embedded workflow metadata and explicit model/LoRA limitations.
- Regional LoRA support in model-specific Attention nodes remains outside this
  release and is planned as a separate backend extension.

### 2026-08-18 — v0.9.0

- Add additive and subtractive rectangle, ellipse and click-to-place polygon tools.
- Extend the `BV_REGIONAL` v1 schema, validation, transforms and backend mask renderer
  with ellipse and polygon geometry while preserving existing documents.
- Add a persistent, inspection-only binary mask preview that resolves enabled mask
  operations and region feather without authoring overlays or background images.
- Show zoom-stable cyan Add/transform and dashed red Subtract previews, live polygon
  edges and canvas-pixel dimensions while drawing, moving or resizing geometry.
- Cover geometry contracts, hit testing, transforms, mask composition, persistence and
  schema validation with frontend and Python regression tests.

### 2026-08-18 — v0.8.0

- Add an experimental Krea 2 regional joint-attention backend with normal KSampler compatibility.
- Route Global, Background and regional Qwen3-VL contexts through all 28 main single-stream attention blocks.

- Normalize missing all-ones Krea attention masks and add architecture/memory guards, tests, an importable regional document and verified screenshots.
- Document that successful regional composition combines prompt engineering, mask geometry, actual spatial need, model priors and sampling settings; attention routing is guidance, not hard layout enforcement.

### 2026-08-18 — v0.7.0

- Add an exact-architecture FLUX.2 Klein 9B joint-attention backend for
  `BV_REGIONAL` documents with standard ComfyUI sampling paths.
- Route Global, Background and regional Qwen3-8B contexts through all double-
  and single-stream attention blocks while preserving `joint` overlap semantics.

- Add dense-mask memory guards, regression coverage, an importable separation-test
  document and verified workflow/editor/result screenshots.
- Document that sampler, scheduler, guidance and model-sampling configuration remain
  caller-owned and must be validated independently from regional routing.

- Add a Z-Image Turbo joint-attention backend for `BV_REGIONAL` documents with
  standard-KSampler positive and zero negative conditioning.

  attention routing, strength, timing and failure behavior with regression tests.
- Add an importable Z-Image Turbo separation-test document and illustrated attention
  and Native workflow evidence.

### 2026-08-18 — v0.5.0

- Add a generic SDXL cross-attention routing backend for `BV_REGIONAL` documents
  with standard-KSampler positive and negative conditioning.
- Validate the backend in real GPU workflows with WAI Illustrious SDXL and Pony
  Diffusion V6 XL, including controlled untuned Native Conditioning comparisons.

  route regions through rendered masks and preserve `joint` overlap semantics.
- Reject non-SDXL model architectures explicitly and cover model detection, routing,
  overlap, strength and failure behavior with regression tests.
- Add an importable SDXL attribute-separation document and illustrated workflow evidence.

### 2026-08-17 — v0.4.1

- Publish an explicit, documented `node_list.json` so ComfyUI Registry and

  key during CI to prevent registry metadata drift.
- Run TypeScript-backed frontend behavior tests through an explicit `tsx`

## Acknowledgements

Generative AI systems served as collaborative development tools throughout this
project, supporting research, code generation, refactoring, test design and
documentation. Their contribution is acknowledged openly alongside the human
architecture, creative direction, review and practical validation behind the pack.

BV Node Pack is built on ComfyUI's extension ecosystem. Several open-source
projects helped shape its product ideas, interaction patterns and technical research:

- [ComfyUI](https://github.com/Comfy-Org/ComfyUI) and
  [ComfyUI Frontend](https://github.com/Comfy-Org/ComfyUI_frontend) provide the
  runtime, graph, Subgraph and extension foundations this pack integrates with.
- [ComfyUI Impact Pack](https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Impact-Pack) provides
  the detector providers, `SEGS` contract and Detailer consumer used by the optional
  detector-aware Regional Detailer Loop integration. BV owns its plan, registry,
  regional crop/mask gating and loop control rather than vendoring Impact internals.
- [rgthree-comfy](https://github.com/rgthree/rgthree-comfy) influenced the focus on
  fast workflow controls, compact graph tooling and practical seed/control UX.
- [ComfyUI_agilly1989_motorway](https://github.com/agilly1989/ComfyUI_agilly1989_motorway)
  was the original inspiration for configurable BV Pipes. Motorway demonstrated
  that a pipe could carry user-named values through a workflow and overwrite an
  existing key downstream instead of relying only on a permanently fixed port set.
  BV Smart Pipe developed that idea further with incremental slot inheritance,
  stable slot identities, independent branches, wireless routing and explicit merges.
- [cg-use-everywhere](https://github.com/chrisgoringe/cg-use-everywhere), commonly
  known as Use Everywhere, inspired the wireless-routing direction. Its approach
  demonstrated how values can be broadcast without visible graph links and how
  routing rules can disambiguate targets in complex workflows. BV Smart Pipe uses
  its own explicit predecessor, stable-address and branch/merge semantics.
- [ComfyUI-KJNodes](https://github.com/kijai/ComfyUI-KJNodes), especially the
  Ideogram regional prompt-builder workflow, inspired the idea of a dedicated
  editor surface that can remain available while navigating the graph.
- [ComfyUI_LC123_nodes](https://github.com/lonecatone23/ComfyUI_LC123_nodes)
  demonstrated painted regional authoring and provided useful Krea 2 and Anima
  workflow references.
- [ComfyUI-Krea2-Regional](https://github.com/januspluto/ComfyUI-Krea2-Regional)
  by januspluto provided the reference implementation and core activation-space
  approach for token-gated single-pass regional LoRA and LoKr execution on Krea 2.
  BV adapts those techniques to its regional document, named LoRA-stack and
  compatibility architecture; the upstream MIT attribution is reproduced in
  [Third-Party Notices](THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md).
- [Comfyui-Anima-Regional-Conditioning](https://github.com/Sen-sou/Comfyui-Anima-Regional-Conditioning)
  provided the technical basis for the built-in Anima patch. Its MIT attribution
  is reproduced in [Third-Party Notices](THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md).
- [RES4LYF](https://github.com/ClownsharkBatwing/RES4LYF) was studied as an
  architectural reference for regional attention, overlap and model-specific
  backends. BV does not copy its implementation.
- [comfy-ex-tagcomplete](https://github.com/jupo-ai/comfy-ex-tagcomplete) informed
  completion behavior and supplied the baseline public tag-data snapshot. BV uses
  its own completion implementation; dataset provenance is documented separately.
